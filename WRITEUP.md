Analysis of Using Azure Web App Over Azure VM

1. Cost Analysis
Azure Web App: Generally more cost-effective for hosting web applications due to its pay-as-you-go pricing model. You only pay for the resources you use, and it includes built-in features like load balancing and auto-scaling without additional costs.
Azure VM: Can be more expensive as you need to manage and maintain the entire virtual machine, including the operating system and any additional software. Costs can add up with the need for continuous uptime, especially if the VM is always running.

2. Scalability
Azure Web App: Offers automatic scaling out-of-the-box. You can easily scale up or down based on demand without manual intervention. This makes it ideal for applications with variable or unpredictable traffic.
Azure VM: Requires manual configuration for scaling. You need to set up and manage load balancers and additional VMs to handle increased traffic, which can be complex and time-consuming.

3. Availability
Azure Web App: Provides built-in high availability with a guaranteed SLA of 99.95% uptime. It automatically handles failover and redundancy, ensuring your application remains available even during maintenance or outages.
Azure VM: While you can achieve high availability, it requires setting up and managing multiple VMs, load balancers, and possibly even geographic redundancy. This adds complexity and potential points of failure.

4. Workflow
Azure Web App: Simplifies the deployment and management workflow. It integrates seamlessly with development tools like Visual Studio, GitHub, and Azure DevOps, allowing for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines4. This reduces the operational overhead and lets developers focus on coding rather than infrastructure management.
Azure VM: Offers more control over the environment, which can be beneficial for specific use cases requiring custom configurations. However, it also means more responsibility for managing updates, security patches, and overall maintenance.

Justification for Selecting Azure Web App Over Azure VM
Azure Web App is selected over Azure VM because it significantly reduces operational complexity and costs while providing robust scalability and high availability. This allows developers to focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure management.
